## Description

Customers check product reviews to decide if they are willing to buy a product.

You just finished creating your new store, your products are ready for sale: But there are no product reviews on your store yet, because you haven’t made any sales yet. Or maybe you had a few orders, but your customers weren’t interested to leave any review. it happens all the time!

Reviews drive future customers a lot and help tremendously in increasing in the conversion rate.

This plugin offers a very easy way to manually add product reviews on stores that use WooCommerce. No need to create so many accounts and so many orders so you can manually add reviews, we thought we could save you the hassle and make it possible for you to add reviews for each product right from the product edit screen on your WordPress dashboard. Wouldn't that be great 

Products with positive reviews have more sales 

When you create a review, you will have the option to make it verified. It will look authentic with that green mark on your product page, and when your future customers leave reviews on your store, the reviews you have created will simply merge with the rest of the reviews, you can modify them, you delete them like any other review.
