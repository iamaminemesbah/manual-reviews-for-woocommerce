A simple and easy way to manually add WooCommerce product reviews from your WordPress dashboard.

== Description ==

Customers prefer going through product reviews to decide if they want to buy a product. üôà

You just finished the setup process for your new store üÜï, your products are ready for sale: But there are no product reviews yet because there are no sales yet. Maybe you are making sales, but your customers are too lazy üò¥ to review the products they bought on your store, it happens all the time!

Reviews assist future customers a lot and help tremendously in increasing in the conversion rate. üîù

This plugin offers a very easy way to manually add product reviews on stores that use WooCommerce. No need to create so many accounts and so many orders so you can manualy add reviews, we thought we could save you the hassle and make it possible for you to add reviews for each product right from the product edit screen on your WordPress dashboard. Wouldn't that be great üòç

Products with positive reviews have more sales ü§ë 

When you create a review, you will have the option to make it verified. It will look authentic with that green mark on your product page, and when your future customers leave reviews on your store, the reviews you have created will simply merge with the rest of the reviews, you can modify them, you delete them like any other review.
